Oh man, okay. Just walked out and my head kinda buzzing, you know? Death of a Unicorn is like one of those dreams you have after too much cheese, weirdly intense and hard to shake off. The theater was a mess, corn kernels everywhere, one got stuck to my shirt. People were shuffling out, talking loudly, which was messing with my concentration. I should've recorded this, ha.

> So, there's this unicorn, right, and it's not just any unicorn. It's got this whole vibe, like David Bowie meets a rainbow after a thunderstorm. Crazy, mesmerizing. But like, it's doomed, from the get-go. You kinda know it's gonna die, 'cause the title and all, but still. Really packs a punch when it happens, and suddenly you're seeing rainbows with a melancholic twist, turning into black and white TV static.

One scene, there's a forest, trees looking like they climbed right out of a Van Gogh painting, swirling like they've got their own dance moves. The unicorn prances through like it's waltzing with eternity or something, and you're like, Damn, can a unicorn really make the woods feel like a concert? But then, reality check in the form of some loud burger wrappers 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ling to my left. Who takes a burger inside anyway? It was downright distracting.

Aching back – those seats need a serious upgrade or my spine ain't cut for cinema marathons anymore. Oh, so when you're gonna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , make sure you’ve got a comfy couch or something. Because honestly? My position was like trying to stuff a giraffe in a Mini Cooper – doesn't quite cut it, y'know?

> The climax is, man, it's like, whoosh, like someone took the Wizard of Oz and mashed it into a blender with Shakespearean tragedy. That moment, when you feel you've seen it all, then it’s curtains (literally and figuratively), left me spellbound. If magic was a flavor, this   was a bittersweet meringue — fluffy yet leaving a lingering sigh.

Afterwards, I stepped outside, night air hit like a soft pillow. Ran my hands through my hair and was like, “Did that unicorn live in my head for a second or was it the lack of coffee catching up?” I should really fix that caffeine fix. Makes you wonder, were the vibrations in the theater from the sound system, or were they from whatever spell this   cast? Either way, worth the popcorn dust and aching vertebrae.
